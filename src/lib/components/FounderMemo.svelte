            <p>Performance management shouldn't feel like archaeology.</p>
            
            <p>I've watched managers drown in admin work—scrambling at review time to piece together six months of work from memory, asking their teams to self-report accomplishments, maintaining spreadsheets that are outdated the moment they're created.</p>
            
            <p>Traditional performance tools turned this into "a process you maintain, not a reality you see." They created heavy systems, forms, and rituals that added noise without clarity.</p>
            
            <p>But growth and performance are happening every day. The context is there—in Slack messages, email threads, meeting notes. It just gets lost.</p>
            
            <p>Sunlight changes this. It's a lighter, calmer way to manage teams. Not another system to maintain. A layer that supports you quietly in the background, capturing the real signals from day-to-day work.</p>
            
            <p>Managing people should be meaningful work focused on growth, course-correction, and celebrating progress—not buried under administrative tasks.</p>
